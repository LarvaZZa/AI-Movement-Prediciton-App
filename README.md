# Movement-Prediciton-App

This application was created to predict the movements of a person using an AI prediction model. The app is launched, the phone is placed upside down in the front left pocket of the pants, and the prediction begins. The app can detect when the person is standing, sitting, biking, walking, jogging, going upstairs and downstairs.

The app uses the Accelerometer to collect the movement data on a custom interval, the data is analyzed and a voice through the phone speakers says what movement has been made. The process is repeated.
